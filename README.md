**Video Call App**

A modern video call platform that connects like-minded individuals based on their interests. Users submit their interests, which are transformed into vector embeddings using state-of-the-art machine learning models. The backend computes cosine similarity between embeddings to automatically match users with similar passions.

ðŸš€ Features:

- Real-Time Matching: Automatically pairs users based on the semantic similarity of their interests.
  
- Scalable Architecture: Frontend hosted on GitHub Pages, backend deployed on Render, with a PostgreSQL database for reliable data storage.

- Machine Learning Integration: Leverages vector embeddings to capture nuanced user interests, enabling accurate and dynamic matchmaking.
  
- Seamless Communication: Facilitates real-time video calls through efficient signaling and connection management.
